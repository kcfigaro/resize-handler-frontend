            While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
            DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
            its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
            object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
            website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
            the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
            you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.</p>
